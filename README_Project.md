	<h2 align="left"> BREAST CANCER PREDICTION MODEL </h2>
	<h4 align="left"> This model is being trained to make predictions about cancer the patient is most likely suffering. This can be used both by medical practitioner and the patient provided data is provided from a proper medical report. The data project predicts whether the patient actually has breast cancer or not. <h4>

## Functionalities
- [ ]  Predict if patient's data predicts between 'Benign' and 'Maligant'. <br>      
	'Benign' cancer is the cancer which doesn't spread whereas 'Malignant' cancer cells spread across the body making it very dangerous.
- [ ]  < ADD FUNCTIONALITY >
